# TelNot

TelNot is a playful server application that mimics a Telnet server with a twist. It's designed to amuse tech enthusiasts and frustrate potential intruders.

## Demo

![TelNot Demo](telnot-demo.gif)

This animation demonstrates how it looks from the client's side - showing how it sends colorful ANSI text files byte-by-byte with random delays. Yes, it is a feature, not a bug.

## Features

- Simulates a Telnet server
- Sends colorful ANSI text files byte-by-byte with random delays
- Supports both Linux (epoll) and macOS/BSD (kqueue) systems
- Uses non-blocking I/O and an event-driven architecture

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tzatko/telnot.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the TelNot directory:
   ```
   cd telnot
   ```
3. Compile the project:
   ```
   make
   ```

### Running on Linux without root privileges

To allow TelNot to bind to port 23 without running as root, you can use the `setcap` command to add the necessary capability:

```
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep ./TelNot
```


## Contributing

### ANSI & ASCII Art

- We want cool ANSI & ASCII art
- Must look good on modern terminals. DOS codepage block art doesn't work quete right.

### Credit

Currently using art from [NNBnh's ansi project](https://github.com/NNBnh/ansi). If you're copying, say so.
